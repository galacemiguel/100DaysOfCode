# #100DaysOfCode ⌨️
This is a purely text-based repository where I will be logging my progress on the #100DaysOfCode challenge!

I didn't want to flood this README with an avalanche of text, so I decided to break my daily logs into 10-day sprints – each with their own Wiki page. I will update this as I go along!

Here's to a successful run! 🤘

## Midpoint Review
It has been a tough 50 days so far! Just finding energy to solve these problems day to day is incredibly difficult and managing consecutive days is even harder. But I have learned some things since the start of this endeavor, so I will be making the following adjustments to try to maximize my success. 💯

### 1. Setting a consistent time ⏰
Keeping up a habit is difficult if not explicitly scheduled within a day. This one is no different. Therefore, I have decided to incorporate this into my morning routine to help address my inconsistency.

### 2. Trusting the process 🛣
More often than not, I have found myself too focused on completing my problems over immersing myself in and enjoying the process of problem-solving. This has wrongfully shifted my goal from learning to forcibly getting things done. As such, I will de-emphasize my 1-problem/1-day correspondence and, in my logs, write more about my process – specific algorithms I am learning or attempting to implement – and less about my success or nonsuccess in solving the problems.

Bring on the next 50! ✊
