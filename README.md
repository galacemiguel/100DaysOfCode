# #100DaysOfCode ‚å®Ô∏è
This is a purely text-based repository where I will be logging my progress on the #100DaysOfCode challenge!

I didn't want to flood this README with an avalanche of text, so I decided to break my daily logs into 10-day chunks ‚Äì each with their own Wiki page. I will update this as I go along!

Here's to a successful run! ü§ò
